# DungeonCrawlerGameJam-Networking-2023
This is a synthwave - inspired dungeon crawler, with a unique weapon experience.



Your only tool is a two-fold ability. 

It acts as a flash light/scan that serves as your light in the dark, and as a weapon.

It is a double-edged sword, capable of attracting entities that cant be killed. 

The color palette is minimal but highly contrasting 

In this way, your tool has a dual nature that protects and endangers 

However, your scan can also be useful against large enemies. By attracting enemies early you are less likely to walk into them and have little time to run.  You give off natural light, and therefore should use this ping to see down long hallways
